# Hi there 👋 Welcome to the NGP Lab GitHub organization!

## Goal

This organization aims to track AI developments and advances in modeling Earth systems and beyond.

<!--
NGP-Lab/.github is a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add README.md to your public organization profile, visible to anyone. Make sure it’s public and and initialize it with a README in the profile directory to get started.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
